Bonus features implemented
--------------------------

1. Colored output for game elements
   --------------------------------
   - We use Windows console colors to distinguish different elements:
     - Player 1: Cyan ('@') 
     - Player 2: Red ('&') 
     - Walls: Brown, drawn as filled block characters (▒ style)
     - Win tile: LightRed, using █ 

2. Dark rooms + torch-based fog-of-war
   -----------------------------------
   - Some rooms are flagged as dark in the Room structure.
   - In a dark room, the map is not drawn fully:
     - Only tiles inside a visibility radius around players with a torch are shown.
     - The rest of the room is completely dark (spaces " ").
   - Visibility uses:
     - radius = 0 when no torch
     - radius = 4 (configurable) when holding a torch
   - This makes navigation more challenging and adds atmosphere compared
     to a fully revealed map.


3. Riddle integration and random simon says (Exercise 1+)
   ------------------------------------------------------
   - The project already includes Riddle and Question classes and a mechanism
     to display riddle screens.
   - Certain tiles in the level ('?') are treated as riddle triggers:
     - When a player tries to step onto such a tile, a riddle is shown.
     - Solving the riddle correctly gives the player points.
   - added a random chance to get a riddle type simon says:
		You will see 4 cubes on the screen.

		The game will highlight/show a sequence of cubes, one after another.
		Example:
		First cube 2 lights up
		Then cube 4
		Then cube 1
		Your job is to memorize the order of the cubes.

		When the sequence ends, you must repeat it by pressing the matching number keys:
		Cube 1 → press 1
		Cube 2 → press 2
		Cube 3 → press 3
		Cube 4 → press 4

		Example: if the cubes lit in this order:
		2 → 4 → 1
		you must press:
		2 4 1

		If you press the correct sequence:
		You pass the riddle and can continue the game with added score.

		If you press a wrong number or wrong order:
		The riddle fails and you wont get points added to your score.
		
		
4. using files for maps menu (ex..)
   --------------------------------
	- the maps load from levelfiles

	- and more uses
   
5. HUD with score board 
   --------------------
   - point will be added to a score on hud.
   - if a player picks up a torch the hud will show picked.
