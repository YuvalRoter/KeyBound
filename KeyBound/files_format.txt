Format Description for KeyBound Game Recording

1. Steps File (adv-world.steps)
--------------------------------
Stores the initial configuration and the sequence of user inputs.

Line 1: <RandomSeed> (unsigned int)
        - Ensures deterministic behavior for random events (Riddles, Simon Says).
Line 2: <MapFileCount> <MapFile1> <MapFile2> ...
        - The number of map files followed by their names, ensuring the game loads the correct levels.
Subsequent Lines: <Time> <InputChar>
        - Time: The game cycle number (long) when the key was pressed.
        - InputChar: The ASCII integer value of the key pressed.

2. Results File (adv-world.result)
----------------------------------
Stores expected game events for validation during playback.

Line 1: <EventCount> (size_t)
        - Total number of recorded events.
Subsequent Lines: <Time> <Type> <Data>
        - Time: The game cycle number (long) when the event occurred.
        - Type: Integer representing the event type:
            0 = ScreenChange (Player moved to a new room)
            1 = LifeLost (Player was hit by a bomb/mine)
            2 = Riddle (Riddle encountered)
            3 = GameEnd (Victory or Game Over)
            4 = BombTick (Internal bomb state, if tracked)
        - Data: A string providing details (e.g., the room index moved to, or the final score).
