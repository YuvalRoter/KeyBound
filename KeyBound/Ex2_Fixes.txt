Exercise 2 – Fixes for Previously Deducted Points
------------------------------------------------------------

In Exercise 2, the following points were deducted:

(-10) Supporting only 3 rooms, hard coded  
(-15) Position of players is hard coded  

Both issues were fully fixed in Exercise 3, as detailed below.


------------------------------------------------------------
Fix #1 – Hard-Coded Number of Rooms
------------------------------------------------------------

Original Issue (Exercise 2):
- The game supported only exactly 3 rooms.
- Room files were hard-coded and loaded manually.

Fix Implemented (Exercise 3):
- The game now dynamically loads all room files listed in the steps file
  or found in the working directory (adv-world_XX.screen).
- The number of rooms is no longer hard-coded.
- Rooms are stored in a vector and indexed dynamically.

Result:
- Any number of rooms can be added without modifying the code.
- The game logic automatically adapts to the number of loaded rooms.


------------------------------------------------------------
Fix #2 – Hard-Coded Player Positions
------------------------------------------------------------

Original Issue (Exercise 2):
- Initial player positions were hard-coded in the code.

Fix Implemented (Exercise 3):
- Player starting positions are now read directly from the room files.
- Each room file contains the initial positions of both players.
- The players are spawned based on the positions found in the map data.

Result:
- Player positions are no longer hard-coded.
- Changing a room file is sufficient to change player spawn positions.
- No code changes are required to modify starting positions.


------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
------------------------------------------------------------

Both previously deducted issues from Exercise 2 were fully resolved
in Exercise 3.

The game now:
- Supports a dynamic number of rooms.
- Uses non-hard-coded player starting positions loaded from room files.

We respectfully request reconsideration of the deducted points
based on these fixes.
